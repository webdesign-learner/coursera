        <p>I am a CLASSICAL DANCER. I have lots if interest  in it. I learned dance proffesionally. I have danced lots of time in schools, temple during festivals and so on. In my school I look popular because even kids know me that's a kind of joy that can't be expressed over world.</p>

        <p>I love cats. Not just as pets, but as companions, as little furry souls that make life better just by being in it. Each cat I've known has had a unique personality, a distinct way of showing affection. Some were playful and bold, others shy and mysterious. But all of them made my life warmer, richer, and somehow more peaceful. Cats don't demand love. They invite it — and in loving them, I've learned patience, gentleness, and how to enjoy the quiet moments more deeply.</p>

        <p>Family, to me, is everything. It's not just about shared blood or a last name — it's about the people who feel like home. My love for family is deep-rooted. Family teaches me what it means to love unconditionally. With them, I don't have to pretend or explain — I'm simply accepted, flaws and all.</p>

        <p>I love my friends for the way they show up — not always with perfect words, but with open hearts. They celebrate my wins like they're their own. They make the ordinary days brighter, and the hard ones bearable. My love for them is constant. </p>

        <p>Listening to music is one of my favourite hobby because it gives me energy. Music has the power to match every mood-whether I am happy, sad or simply being.  Music not only entertains me but also connects me with emotions and thoughts. It is like a constant companion that makes everyday in life more colorful.</p>

        <h2>My Interest</h2>
        <div>
        <h4>Editing images</h4>
        <p>I'm drawn to image editing because it's a perfect blend of creativity and technical skill. I enjoy transforming raw visuals into polished, compelling images—whether it's through color correction, retouching, background manipulation, or creative effects. There's something powerful about being able to enhance a photo's mood, focus the viewer's attention, or tell a stronger visual story with just a few adjustments. What I find most exciting is the ability to bring a vision to life. Whether I'm working on portraits, product photography, digital art, or social media content, I love the process of refining the details—sharpening, adjusting lighting, removing distractions—to make the final image stand out. Image editing is not just about making things look good; it's about intention, message, and impact. That's what keeps me passionate about improving my skills and exploring new tools and techniques.</p>

        <h4>Ux design</h4>
        <p>I'm genuinely interested in UX design because it's all about creating meaningful and seamless experiences for people. What draws me in is the way UX combines empathy, creativity, and logic to solve real-world problems. I love the idea of designing products that are not just visually appealing, but truly useful—where every interaction feels natural and intuitive. UX design interests me because it puts the user at the center. It's not just about making things look good—it's about understanding people, anticipating their needs, and making their digital journeys easier and more enjoyable. That focus on improving real human experiences is what makes UX so exciting to me.</p>
